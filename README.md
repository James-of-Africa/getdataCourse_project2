#  Getting and Cleaning Data - Project2
Project 2 for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course

Make sure that the dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip is unzipped into your R working directory. This should create the data folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' in your working directory. 

Running the run_analysis.R script from the command line or the repl should generate a summary of the data set in the file 'out.txt'.

See the codebook for more information on the output data structure.
